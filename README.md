This is a basic recipe website built to practice HTML and eventually CSS.  During this initial build it will be used to practice HTML boilerplate and utilizing Git Hub.  HTML elements to be inlcuded are headers, paragraphs, images, links, lists, and tags.  By the end of this project I should have more autonomy working on HTML, a better understanding of utilizing Git Hub, and I'm goin to do additional research to continue becoming more efficient usining visual studio code.  Currently workspaces are a little confusing to me in VScode so I'd like to build a better understanding by the end of this lesson.
