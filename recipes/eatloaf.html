        This is a heart healthy spin on the classic and mysterious dish of meatloaf.
        Inspired in our kitchen less so to save cute kitty and more so to eat more 
        whole foods.  This delightful blend of veggies, greens, and beans will most
        definitely be tasty af, be good for your heart, and possibly make you fart as
        the old nursery rhyme goes.

        <ol>
            <li>Wash all your veggies using a strainer in cool water and allow time to airdry
                (or use dish soap like viral chicken guy... to each theirown)</li>
            <li>Sautee peppers, onions, zucchini, and garlic in a ginormous skillet/wok over med-high
                heat.  Feel free to use a bit of cooking oil here if you prefer, our
                go to is olive oil.  If you would like to keep this meal more whole food based
                1/2 to 1 tbsp may be added as needed to the center of your impressively large
                skillet of choice as needed.  Saute until all veggies are appropriately

                <li>Once veggies are at the proper level of delicousness add your kale, then add
